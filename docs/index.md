# Welcome to DevLang — Programming in Hindi for Everyone!

DevLang is a JavaScript-based programming language that brings the warmth and familiarity of **Hindi keywords** to the world of coding. Imagine writing programs where `bolo` prints your messages, `agar` checks conditions, and `jabtak` creates loops — making programming feel more natural and intuitive for Hindi speakers and language enthusiasts alike.

Built as an interpreted language for beginners and experienced developers, DevLang bridges the gap between natural language and code. It's designed to make programming accessible, educational, and enjoyable by letting you think and code in a language that feels closer to home.

Whether you're learning your first programming concepts, teaching others, or simply exploring how languages can be more inclusive, DevLang offers a unique and welcoming approach to coding. Every keyword carries the spirit of making technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their native tongue.

Join our growing community of developers who believe that programming should speak everyone's language. Let's make coding as inclusive as the languages we speak every day!

## Philosophy

> "Programming should speak everyone's language, not just English."

DevLang is built on the belief that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of the language they speak. By making programming more inclusive through localized keywords, we hope to inspire the next generation of developers who might have been held back by language barriers.

Let's code in a language that feels like home! 🚀
